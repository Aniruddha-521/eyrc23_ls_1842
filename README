//Eyantra Lunar Scout Theme//

eYRC 2023-24 introduces “Lunar Scout”, an omni wheel self-balancing bike robot which is used for patrolling and scouting the lunar colony. The Lunar Scout is no ordinary bike. With its self-balancing technology and auto-steering features, it can effortlessly navigate through the rough and challenging terrain of the moon. It has been deployed as a patrolling scout, tasked with travelling the lunar colony and signalling any potential hazards or emergencies to the command centre. This two-wheeled bike uses rotary steer to maintain balance, allowing it to traverse through steep slopes and uneven surfaces with ease. In this theme, the participants have to build Lunar Scout, while also building up skills in control systems, mathematical modelling, mechanical design, embedded systems and programming. The robot will be required to navigate through a custom-built obstacle course, signalling any potential hazards or emergencies to the command centre. Participants will be judged based on the speed and accuracy of their robot's navigation, as well as its ability to perform various tasks.
